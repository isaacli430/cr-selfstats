# Clash Royale SelfStats
_A selfbot dedicated to getting your CR stats!_

# Command Help
This is a very simple selfbot that only has 3 commands:
```
profile [Player ID, defaults to your ID if left empty]
```
```
clan [Clan ID, defaults to your clan ID if left empty] [The type of tag you're using (player or clan), defaults to clan if left empty]
```
```
presence [stream/online/idle/dnd/invisible] [The message you want to display]
```

Here are examples of the commands being used:
```
st.profile GYUGPLYL    #Returns the stats of the player with the ID #GYUGPLYL
```
```
st.clan GYUGPLYL player    #Returns the stats of the player GYUGPLYL's clan
```
```
st.presence stream CR-SelfStats    #Now the user appears to be streaming, with the status message being CR-SelfStats
```
